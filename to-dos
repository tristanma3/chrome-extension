save the state(active tabs, time opened)-mark time when open tab
track the website without opening the extension

create a list(ordered by times) to save the times when tabs are opened

add a listener function for when closing tabs (add null urls placeholder...)





//tracking the time spent on each url (future can be website)
//track for all time/ whenever the extension is started (future can track specific time sections)
//take current tab time and subtract previous tab time to find how long the previous tab was active
0 - 1 - 2;
3;
4;

//after calculating time spent on active tab, create new object with url/time active
//key of object is website url --> gets combined time of all the similar urls
function tracker(log) {} 
HashMap<String, double> timeSpent = new HashMap<String, double>();
for(int i = 0; i<result.length;i++){
    String url1 = result[i].getUrl();
    if(i==result.length-1)
    {
        double time1 = curentTime - result[i].getTime();
    }
    else
    {
        double time1 = result[i+1].getTime()-result[i].getTime();
    }
    timeSpent.put(url1,time1);
}


create d3 graph (bar) use percentages or just minuites
